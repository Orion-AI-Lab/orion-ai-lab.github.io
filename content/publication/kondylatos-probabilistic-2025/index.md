abstract: Label noise poses a significant challenge in Earth Observation (EO), often
  degrading the performance and reliability of supervised Machine Learning (ML) models.
  Yet, given the critical nature of several EO applications, developing robust and
  trustworthy ML solutions is essential. In this study, we take a step in this direction
  by leveraging probabilistic ML to model input-dependent label noise and quantify
  data uncertainty in EO tasks, accounting for the unique noise sources inherent in
  the domain. We train uncertainty-aware probabilistic models across a broad range
  of high-impact EO applications-spanning diverse noise sources, input modalities,
  and ML configurations-and introduce a dedicated pipeline to assess their accuracy
  and reliability. Our experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware models
  consistently outperform the standard deterministic approaches across most datasets
  and evaluation metrics. Moreover, through rigorous uncertainty evaluation, we validate
  the reliability of the predicted uncertainty estimates, enhancing the interpretability
  of model predictions. Our findings emphasize the importance of modeling label noise
  and incorporating uncertainty quantification in EO, paving the way for more accurate,
  reliable, and trustworthy ML solutions in the field.
