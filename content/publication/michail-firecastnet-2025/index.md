abstract: With climate change expected to exacerbate fire weather conditions, the
  accurate and timely anticipation of wildfires becomes increasingly crucial for disaster
  mitigation. In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire
  dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables,
  to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive
  analysis, we present FireCastNet, a novel architecture which combines a 3D convolutional
  encoder with GraphCast, originally developed for global short-term weather forecasting
  using graph neural networks. FireCastNet is trained to capture the context leading
  to wildfires, at different spatial and temporal scales. Our investigation focuses
  on assessing the effectiveness of our model in predicting the presence of burned
  areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months
  into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the
  performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models in seasonal
  fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions, while
  integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts
  performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer
  forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.
