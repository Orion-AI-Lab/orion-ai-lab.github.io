abstract: The global occurrence, scale, and frequency of wildfires pose significant
  threats to ecosystem services and human livelihoods. To effectively quantify and
  attribute the antecedent conditions for wildfires, a thorough understanding of Earth
  system dynamics is imperative. In response, we introduce the SeasFire datacube,
  a meticulously curated spatiotemporal dataset tailored for global sub-seasonal to
  seasonal wildfire modeling via Earth observation. The SeasFire datacube comprises
  of 59 variables encompassing climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human factors,
  has an 8-day temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees, and spans
  from 2001 to 2021. We showcase the versatility of SeasFire for exploring the variability
  and seasonality of wildfire drivers, modeling causal links between ocean-climate
  teleconnections and wildfires, and predicting sub-seasonal wildfire patterns across
  multiple timescales with a Deep Learning model. We publicly release the SeasFire
  datacube and appeal to Earth system scientists and Machine Learning practitioners
  to use it for an improved understanding and anticipation of wildfires.
