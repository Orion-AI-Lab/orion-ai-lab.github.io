abstract: Wildfire forecasting is notoriously hard due to the complex interplay of
  different factors such as weather conditions, vegetation types and human activities.
  Deep learning models show promise in dealing with this complexity by learning directly
  from data. However, to inform critical decision making, we argue that we need models
  that are right for the right reasons; that is, the implicit rules learned should
  be grounded by the underlying processes driving wildfires. In that direction, we
  propose integrating causality with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that explicitly
  model the causal mechanism among complex variables via graph learning. The causal
  adjacency matrix considers the synergistic effect among variables and removes the
  spurious links from highly correlated impacts. Our methodology's effectiveness is
  demonstrated through superior performance forecasting wildfire patterns in the European
  boreal and mediterranean biome. The gain is especially prominent in a highly imbalanced
  dataset, showcasing an enhanced robustness of the model to adapt to regime shifts
  in functional relationships. Furthermore, SHAP values from our trained model further
  enhance our understanding of the model's inner workings.
