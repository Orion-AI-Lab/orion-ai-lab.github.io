abstract: With climate change expected to exacerbate fire weather conditions, the
  accurate anticipation of wildfires on a global scale becomes increasingly crucial
  for disaster mitigation. In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global
  wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables,
  to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive
  analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture
  the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing
  the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at
  varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the
  future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance
  of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models
  in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions
  across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture
  wildfire spatiotemporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that
  in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive
  field spatially needs to be considered.
