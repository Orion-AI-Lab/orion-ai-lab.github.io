abstract: We present Plato, a novel semantic data cube system leveraging Ontology-Based
  Data Access technologies. The concept of semantic data cubes, pioneered by Augustin
  et al., offers a novel approach to managing Earth Observation data, intertwining
  symbolic high-level concepts with raw numerical values. While data cube infrastructures
  have gained prominence, Plato stands out by bridging the gap between ontology-driven
  semantics and multidimensional data storage, enabling users to glean insights from
  data in a more intuitive and integrated manner. By employing Ontology-Based Data
  Access methodologies, Plato establishes connections between ontologies capturing
  geospatial knowledge and underlying data sources, facilitating seamless querying
  and interpretation. In this paper we describe the software architecture of Plato,
  we discuss its applications in the context of the DeepCube project and we evaluate
  its performance with real data from these applications.
