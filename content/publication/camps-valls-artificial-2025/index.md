abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has deeply impacted various
  fields, including Earth system sciences, by improving weather forecasting, model
  emulation, parameter estimation, and the prediction of extreme events. The latter
  comes with specific challenges, such as developing accurate predictors from noisy,
  heterogeneous, small sample sizes and data with limited annotations. This paper
  reviews how AI is being used to analyze extreme climate events (like floods, droughts,
  wildfires, and heatwaves), highlighting the importance of creating accurate, transparent,
  and reliable AI models. We discuss the hurdles of dealing with limited data, integrating
  real-time information, and deploying understandable models, all crucial steps for
  gaining stakeholder trust and meeting regulatory needs. We provide an overview of
  how AI can help identify and explain extreme events more effectively, improving
  disaster response and communication. We emphasize the need for collaboration across
  different fields to create AI solutions that are practical, understandable, and
  trustworthy to enhance disaster readiness and risk reduction.
