GREEK NATIONAL SATELLITE SPACE PROJECT: AXIS 3 SAFETY AND SECURITY SERVICE

- Role:       Partner
- Period:     2024-2026
- Funded by:  The European Commission and the Hellenic Republic   

<!--more-->
Orion Lab is leading the Wildfire Analysis and Surveillance component of the safety and security service, leveraging cutting-edge deep learning (DL) technologies and ultra-high-resolution thermal satellite data from the Greek National Satellite Space Project to tackle wildfires in Greece. Their key contributions include:

1.	Dataset Creation & AI Pipelines
    - Developing and curating datasets to support AI-driven insights.
    - Implementing pipelines for advanced wildfire analysis.
2.	Earth System Modeling
    - Modeling environmental systems to predict and analyze wildfire behavior.
3.	Natural Hazards Monitoring & Forecasting
    -	Wildfire Danger Forecasting: Anticipating areas at high risk for wildfires.
    -	Fire Risk Assessment: Evaluating ongoing risks for extreme events detection
    -	Active Fire Detection: Near Real-time monitoring of active wildfire events.
4.	Post-Fire Monitoring and Risk Analysis
    - Burn Scar Mapping: Identifying and mapping areas affected by fires.
    - Fire Severity Mapping: Assessing the intensity of wildfire damage.
    - Restoration and Regeneration Monitoring: Tracking ecosystem recovery after wildfires.
