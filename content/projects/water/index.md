GREEK NATIONAL SATELLITE SPACE PROJECT: AXIS 3 WATER MONITORING SERVICE

- Role:       Partner
- Period:     2024-2026
- Funded by:  The European Commission and the Hellenic Republic   

<!--more-->
Orion Lab is leading the Water Monitoring Service, focusing on inland water extent mapping and monitoring across Greece using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. By implementing cutting-edge technologies in the field of Earth Observation, such as data fusion and deep learning, the project aims to ensure accurate monitoring adapted to Greece’s unique environmental conditions. Key contributions include:

1. Creating a Training Dataset
    - Developing a large-scale training dataset by integrating Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 multispectral, DEM, and Corine Land Cover data.
    - Creating annotation labels of inland waters through photo-interpretation to address Greece’s environmental conditions.

2. AI Pipelines
    - Training a deep learning model on the developed dataset for water extent mapping.
    - Implementing pipelines to generate inland water segmentation products.

3. Inland Water Extent Monitoring
    - Producing monthly and annual products of inland water across Greek territory.
    - Ensuring accurate validation through expert photo-interpretation and precision metrics.
