OrionLab is a key partner in the Thermal Space Segment of the Greek National Satellite Space Project, driving advancements in deep learning for remote sensing. Our role focuses on integrating edge computing into satellite systems to efficiently produce and transfer Analysis Ready Data (ARD), essential for rapid response in safety and security contexts. Efforts focus on optimizing on-board deep learning pipelines and thoroughly validating the software on the FlatSat platform to ensure reliability under space-like conditions. Key contributions include:

1. On-board Object Detection: Utilizing multispectral imaging alongside deep learning techniques to effectively segment various phenomena such as clouds, fire, and smoke, enhancing remote sensing capabilities. 

2. Testing on the FlatSat: The FlatSat platform serves as a crucial testbed that emulates realistic space conditions, allowing thorough testing and confirmation that the processing pipelines are efficient and reliable enough for space deployment.
