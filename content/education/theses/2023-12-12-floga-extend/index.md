Orion Lab has assembled a novel benchmark dataset, namely FLOGA [1], for the mapping of burnt areas in the Greek region. The dataset comprises bitemporal image acquisitions from Sentinel-2 and MODIS satellites and the ground truth labels are photointerpretation mappings produced by Hellenic Fire Brigade experts. A total of 326 wildfire events all over Greece for the period 2017-2021 are covered. We have also designed a state-of-the-art Deep Learning architecture, BAM-CD, for automatic burn scar mapping using FLOGA (trained only on Sentinel-2 data).

The aim of this thesis is to extend the FLOGA dataset with several other wildfire events worldwide. Several other datasets for this task have been proposed in the literature covering a variety of countries and can serve as possible sources. For example, BARD [2], CaBuAr [3], NIFC GeoMAC Historic Perimeters [4] [5], Satellite Burnt Area Dataset [6], MultiEarth 2023 [7], HLS Burn Scar Scenes [8], etc.

Subsequently, the BAM-CD model will be finetuned on the new data and its performance will be assessed.
