The goal of this thesis is to investigate Deep Learning techniques for the translation of SAR data into multispectral imagery. In particular, the student will utilise a public dataset offering aligned image pairs of the Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) satellites, such as SEN1-2 [1]. Several DL models can be explored, such as [2]-[4], and their performance will be assessed and compared.

**Prerequisites:** Strong Python skills, Machine Learning basic concepts, Deep Learning python framework (Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc)

**Supervisor:** Maria Sdraka
